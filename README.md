# MY LINUX SETUP!

The run-setup script will setup linux how I like it. Paste it line-by-line for now. Change appropriate paths manually.

I am also using this folder to create commands for windows (i.e create my windows <--> Linux dev environment)

Personal project. Im just using Github to back it up.

How to use:

1. Put the (space separated) aliases you want in a file called 'aliases' in the config folder.

	- _Somehow update the ip file based on the ip of the VM. Easy to do in WSL._
2. Run this service as admin in windows to watch changes to the ip or alias file, and automatically update the windows hosts file.
